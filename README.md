# book-recommendation-system
This project focuses on building a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems to predict user preferences by collecting preferences from many users. The goal is to recommend books to users based on their past interactions and similarities with other users. The project will cover the complete pipeline, including data loading, exploratory data analysis, data preparation, model building, evaluation, and visualization.
It was completed under the 3MTT program.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the concept of collaborative filtering and its application in recommendation systems.
- Learn to preprocess and analyze user-item interaction data.
- Gain experience in building a user-item matrix and computing user similarities.
- Implement a recommendation system using cosine similarity.
- Evaluate the recommendation system using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualize user similarities and analyze the most recommended books.
